# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm Austin Cole, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will cover a variety of topics that I'm passionate about:

- **Technology & IT Leadership** - Insights from my role as Deputy IT Director and CISO

## My Background

I serve as a Deputy IT Director and Chief Information Security Officer, bringing years of experience in technology leadership and cybersecurity. I'm also actively involved in emergency management and volunteer with the IT Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC), helping communities recover from disasters through technology solutions.

As a licensed ham radio operator, I enjoy exploring both the technical and emergency communication aspects of amateur radio.
