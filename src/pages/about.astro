                Hi! I'm a seasoned IT professional with over 20 years of
                experience in technology and cybersecurity. I currently serve as
                Deputy IT Director and Chief Information Security Officer,
                bringing extensive expertise in both cyber and physical security
                to my role.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                I'm passionate about building community connections through
                technology and emergency preparedness. As President and Founder
                of CommUnity NexUs, Inc. nonprofit and the Do Something Amateur
                Radio Club (DSARC), I work to strengthen our local community
                resilience. I also serve as Unit Commander for Latah County
                Auxiliary Communications, County Emergency Coordinator for ARES,
                and volunteer with the IT Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC),
                demonstrating my commitment to public safety and emergency
                management.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                I balance my professional responsibilities with service as an
                EMT/Firefighter with Genesee Fire Department. My technical
                interests span cybersecurity, DIY IoT projects, electronics, and
                ham radio operations. When I'm not working, I enjoy restoring my
                1973 Ford Mustang convertible and taking motorcycle rides
                through the beautiful Idaho countryside.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Originally from Houston, Texas, I now call the small town of
                Genesee, Idaho home, where I live with my wife Heather and
                5-year-old son Austin Junior (AJ). Despite my busy professional
                life, family remains my greatest passion, and I treasure our
                Sunday adventures and church time together. Balancing work and
                family life can be challenging with all my responsibilities, but
                I try my best to make time for what matters most.

                I'm a proud Texan at heart with deep roots in technology,

                    <p>
                        I live in the small town of Genesee, Idaho with my wife
                        Heather and 5-year-old son Austin Junior (AJ). Family is
                        my greatest passion, and despite my busy professional
                        life, I prioritize spending quality time with them,
                        especially on Sundays with church and family adventures.
                        We love going on motorcycle and car rides together,
                        exploring the beautiful Idaho countryside and making
                        memories as a family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally from Houston, Texas, I appreciate my
                        small-town Idaho lifestyle but maintain my Texas pride
                        and fondly remember our family ranch in the hill country
                        of Bandera, along with the unique food, culture, and
                        spirit that makes Texas special.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my garage, you'll find my pride and joy - a 1973 Ford
                        Mustang convertible that I've been restoring. When
                        weather permits, I enjoy taking my motorcycle out for
                        solo rides, but even better are the family rides with
                        Heather and AJ - whether it's cruising in the Mustang or
                        adventures on the bike. Balancing all my work
                        commitments with family time isn't always easy, but
                        these moments together make it all worthwhile.
